    <a id="tribute-info"> Mr. King was a crucial figure during the civil rights era. As a priest, he lead the way for blacks at the time, whom were held down by current laws from the Jim Crowe era. Eventually, however, his willingness to push back against the norms lead him to his early and tragic death. Outside memphis where a rally was taking place, he was assasinated. His death however, didn't go in vein. He is someone who is continually admired for the way he not only invisioned the future, but did everything he could to help create that future. Lastly, his legacy was so great that their is now a holiday in his memory, named MLK day.  </a>
